  "body": "Welcome to the HCDESLib!\r\n\r\nDo your simulation models contain more complex structures and control policies than queuing networks? Then HCDESLib might help you!\r\nHCDESLib is a software library in C# to create and run Discrete Event Simulation Models based on the principles of the [HCCM](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569190X15000647) framework. \r\n\r\nThe main idea behind HCCM is to build DES models without explicitly modeling queues. An advanced control mechanism for simulation models is included instead. This control structure enables more complex control policies, avoids the explicit definition of consumer and resource rules and is more flexible in terms of model control. Hence, HCDESLib is especially suited for simulation implementation of DES models with a high degree of entity interaction and complex dispatching and/or control policies. Models where resources are human beings instead of machines often include these complexities, therefore, HCDESLib maybe used for those kind of models.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/nikolausfurian/HCDESLib/blob/master/Pictures/VisualizationExample.jpg)\r\n\r\nCurrently, the main focus of the simulation library is the health care domain, however, the most basic classes and principles can be transported to other domains. Within the health care domain, modules for emergency-, outpatient-, and special service models are provided. In the next release modules for inpatient facilities and patient transit will be published.",
